How to use
==========

The `BLOB support in Plone`__ is amazing for a lot of reasons.

__ https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.blob

However, right now, Plone will raise errors when you visit a file content that use BLOB support,
without having also the BLOB file.

I don't know if this is good or not (I opened `an issue`__ related to this), but for developers this
can be a little boring. It's quite common to copy a production ``Data.fs`` for developing something
using production data, but you don't always want to copy all blobs.

__ http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/11293

This product monkey-patches some points inside Plone, so visiting objects that store content in blob-Fields (like ATFile/ATImage) without its BLOB available will not show any errors to visitors. Instead a file only containing the string "File created by experimental.gracefulblobmissing." is created in the place where the blob-file should be.


Catalog
-------

This product also patches the ``SearchableText`` Archetypes method, so you can reindex
you catalog without errors.
